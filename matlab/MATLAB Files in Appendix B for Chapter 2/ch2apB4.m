% (ch2apB4): An F(s) in factored form can be represented in polynomial form. 
% Thus P3 = (s+2)(s+5)(s+6) can be transformed into a polynomial using poly(V), 
% where V is a row vector containing the roots of the polynomial and poly(V) 
% forms the coefficients of the polynomial.

P3=poly([-2 -5 -6])                  % Store polynomial
                                     % (s+2)(s+5)(s+6) as P3 and 
                                     % display the coefficients
